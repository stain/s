Skype redirection

This page can be used to get a 303 See Other HTTP redirect to a Skype
resource. For instance, if you are using a wiki that only accepts
http:// hyperlinks, but you wanted to link to skype:echo123 to call the
user echo123, you can instead link to http://s11.no/s/skype:echo123.
This page will also provide a link to download Skype if it has not been
installed or the skype: protocol is not registered in the browser.

The URIs minted below http://s11.no/s/skype: can also be used for
statements about Skype contacts in RDF if the unregistered skype:
protocol is not desireable.

Examples:

Replace echo123 with your Skype name

http://s11.no/s/echo123
http://s11.no/s/skype:echo123
http://s11.no/s/skype:echo123?chat
http://s11.no/s/skype:echo123?userinfo
http://s11.no/s/skype:?chat&blob=vWcspqbJZRTzxKXx051UMs6vlXxZWYVObsHSXxUkJLSErG9cKA4
Tips

To find your own Skype name, click "Profile" in Skype.

To find the Skype name of a contact, right click on the contact within
Skype and click "View contact"

To find the URI for a group chat in Skype, type /get uri into the chat
window. Append that to http://s11.no/s/

For persistent Skype telcons, click "Create a group" and then use /topic
Something something to give it a name. Participants who followed the
links can click "Join call", lurk in the text chat, or leave the chat.
(Note: the Linux Skype client and older OS X clients are currently not
able to initiate a group call in this way, and will instead create a
duplicate call which can't be joined by URI.)
